# Development Environment

These VSCode devcontainers setup multiple environments for testing against
different python versins.

## Setup

```
$ git clone git@github.com:splintered-reality/py_trees.git
$ code ./py_trees
```

## VSCode DevContainer

At this point you can either "Re-open project in container" to develop against
the default python version.

Alternatively "Open Folder in Container" and point it at one of the
`py<MAJOR><MINOR>` subfolders in this directory to develop against a different
python version.
